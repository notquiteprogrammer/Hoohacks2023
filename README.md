sustainability app - photo recognition of foods and expiration dates
 
 Front End:
  - Taking a picture and then either stripping the text off the image and converting it to a text file or reading from the image directly. Then process the data and display information pertaining to the food read off the receipt.
 
 
 Back End:
 - Using the food information read off the receipt, output data for the possible items. Probably where most of the logistics will be contained.
 
 
 
 Database:
 - Google Cloud Database containing possible food options and their specific information like calories, how long it takes to expire, maybe more nutritional information, etc.
